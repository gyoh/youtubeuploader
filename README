Requirements
------------

* [scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/)
* [sbt-0.7](https://github.com/mpeltonen/sbt-idea/tree/sbt-0.7)

Usage
-----

Load up SBT in the normal way:

    gyoh$ sbt

To upload all the mp4 or m4v files under the certain directory to YouTube and embed them in your tumblelog, run the program as follows:

    > run [directory path] [YouTube name] [YouTube password] [tumblr name] [tumblr email] [tumblr password]

tumblr name is the subdomain of your tumblr url.
For instance, if your tumblr URL is "foo.tumblr.com", then your tumblr name is "foo".

If you do not use tumblr and just want to upload videos to YouTube, run the program as follows:

    > run [directory path] [YouTube name] [YouTube password]
